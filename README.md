# Gostache

A Go implementation of the command line [mustache(1)](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html) program.

## Overview

Gostache is a substitute for the command line mustashe processor from the original mustache project, which is written in Ruby. Gostache is for those who don't want to or can't install Ruby for whatever reason to be able to use the same command line interface for rendering templates wrapped up in a portable Go binary.

## Documentation

For mustache, have a look at the [main project page](http://github.com/defunkt/mustache). For usage, run `gostache` or have a look at the [mustache(1) man page](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html). It takes the same inputs as the original sans some of the debugging flags.

## Installation

Run `go get github.com/cromo/gostache`. This will fetch and install the gostache binary.

## Usage

See the [mustache(1) man page](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html).
